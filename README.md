Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

totalNEI <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, NEI, sum)

plot(totalNEI$year, totalNEI$Emissions, type = "o", col = "steelblue3", main = expression("Total US "~ PM[2.5]~ "Emissions by Year"), ylab = expression("Total US "~   PM[2.5] ~ "Emissions"), xlab = "Year")


2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == “24510”) from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

baltimore <- subset(NEI, NEI$fips == "24510")

totalBaltimore <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, baltimore, sum)

plot(totalBaltimore$year, totalBaltimore$Emissions, type = "o", main = expression("Total Baltimore" ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Emissions by Year"), xlab = "Year", ylab = expression("Total Baltimore "~ PM[2.5] ~ "Emissions"), col = "steelblue3")


3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question. library(ggplot2)

baltimore <- subset(NEI, NEI$fips == "24510")
baltimoreType <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year + type, baltimore, sum)

ggplot(baltimoreType, aes(year, Emissions, col = type)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_point() +
      ggtitle(expression("Total Baltimore " ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Emissions by Type and Year")) +
      ylab(expression("Total Baltimore " ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Emissions")) +
      xlab("Year") +
      scale_colour_discrete(name = "Type of sources") +
      theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"))


4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999-2008?

SCCcoal <- SCC[grepl("coal", SCC$Short.Name, ignore.case = T),]
NEIcoal <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% SCCcoal$SCC,]
totalCoal <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year + type, NEIcoal, sum)

ggplot(totalCoal, aes(year, Emissions, col = type)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_point() +
      ggtitle(expression("Total US" ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Coal Emission by Type and Year")) +
      xlab("Year") +
      ylab(expression("US " ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Coal Emission")) +
      scale_colour_discrete(name = "Type of sources") +
      theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"))


5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City?

baltimoreMotor <- subset(NEI, NEI$fips == "24510" & NEI$type == "ON-ROAD")
baltimoreMotorAGG <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, baltimoreMotor, sum)

ggplot(baltimoreMotorAGG, aes(year, Emissions)) +
      geom_line(col = "steelblue3") +
      geom_point(col = "steelblue3") +
      ggtitle(expression("Baltimore " ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Motor Vehicle Emissions by Year")) +
      xlab("Year") +
      ylab(expression(~PM[2.5]~ "Motor Vehicle Emissions"))


6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == “06037”). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

baltLosAngelesMotors <- subset(NEI, NEI$fips %in% c("24510","06037") & NEI$type == "ON-ROAD")
baltLosAngelesMotorsAGG <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year + fips, baltLosAngelesMotors, sum)

ggplot(baltLosAngelesMotorsAGG, aes(year, Emissions, col = fips)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_point() +
      ggtitle(expression("Baltimore and Los Angeles" ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Motor Vehicle Emissions by Year")) +
      labs(x = "Year", y = expression(~PM[2.5]~ "Motor Vehicle Emissions") ) +
      scale_colour_discrete(name = "City", labels = c("Los Angeles", "Baltimore")) +
      theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
